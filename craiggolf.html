            <h2>My Golf Journey ...</h2>


            <p> I started playing when I was 7 years of age. I played with my friend Richard alot at his local course as
                I
                wasn't a member anywhere yet. We used to get a packed lunch and play 36 holes no bother at all. When
                I was circa 14 I was lucky enough to join the Stakis Hotel (soon to be bought over by Hilton Group) as a
                junior member which in those days you must be accompanied by an adult. Lucky for me my Uncle Harry moved
                from Ballyclare Golf Club. Back then the Hilton was the place to be. It was a local David Jones
                designed,Par72, Championship Golf Course as pure as the driven snow. When the course opened under Stakis
                hotel Group, the members were allowed out prior to official opening to get some holes in. There wasn't a
                blemish in sight. Just simply beautiful.</p>


            <p>My best round was 80gross playing off 16 when I was 15 years old. I'll always remember it because my
                cousins
                were over from England visiting and we liked to compete against one another. I layed up on the Par 5
                18th
                and
                tugged it left into the hazard but luckily it was somewhat playable. I knew what was at stake so the
                socks
                had
                to come off and the trouser legs were rolled up and in I went. (Back then the water was nice and clear
                with
                little growth so was easy to get in and see a stance) I remember gripping down on a 9 iron and hitting a
                controlled shot onto the green, then 2-putted for my par. Bliss. Couldn't wait to get home to tell my
                dad. I
                always and to this day still feel like I play for my dad and my uncle as they are always keen to know
                how I
                get
                on after every round. As happy as I was I knew I could have done better and shooting in the 70's was the
                next
                goal.</p>


            <p>Little did I know what was around the corner for me. One motorbike accident later, high school drop out
                and
                thinking I was jack the lad, the golf just stopped as quick as you could say "Get in the Hole". I'd like
                to
                note for the previous reasons I pretty much missed the 'Tiger Era' on TV. Monty was my hero growing up.
                7
                time
                European Order of Merrit Winner. Played with a great big overswing, cupped left wrist and a high,
                deliberate
                follow through enabled him to hit tight cuts time after time. Grumpy big sod mind you but boy he could
                play.
